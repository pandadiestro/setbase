# SetBase
*the boolean database model*

SetBase is a conceptual database made in Go based on the idea of gruping data in sets and querying it by boolean algebra expressions which can be evaluated as set operations. This is useful for use-cases where you need to query registers by its metadata rather than by its components, like searching images by tags.

As a test data sample im using the waifus from [this amazing repo!](https://github.com/cat-milk/Anime-Girls-Holding-Programming-Books).
